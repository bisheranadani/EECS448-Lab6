Bugs:
1) addBack works for only one number. Using addBack to add more than one number results in it only adding the last number
2) isEmpty always returns true
3) removeBack still returns false despite seeming to do its job correctly
4) removeFront does not work; removes all values except the front and always returns false
5) Size does not decrement or change for removeBack or removeFront
